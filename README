The DAIA project is grouped into modules that can be used independently:

phpDaia - PHP implementation
daiapm  - DAIA perl module
xslt    - XSLT client

In addition some common modules group resources used by other modules:

schemas - DAIA XSD and OWL schemas for validating

Please make sure that all packaged distributions can be used independently!
This can be done by copying content from the common modules.
