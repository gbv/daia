phpDaia is a PHP library to build DAIA information.

It's pretty simple to install phpDAIA.

Just copy the files to a directory on your webserver. To communicate with your ILS you need to 
edit daia.ini with the data of your library.
If you are using the DAIA server in addition to a PICA server, you have to modify the Catalog-Urls
according to your needs.

Currently only PICA systems are supported. 
Since you may have diffenrences in your local PICA systems, there is no warranty that your PICA system 
works together with the DAIA server without problems.

You can check your DAIA server by calling 
http://<your-webserver>/<your-directory>/daia_ws.php?ppn=<one ppn from you catalog>
Your PHP must support XSLT-transformation to view the DAIA page in HTML.
If you do not see a result here, just try to view the pure XML result:
http://<your-webserver>/<your-directory>/daia_ws.php?output=xml&ppn=<one ppn from you catalog>

The XSL-Stylesheet, the icons and the CSS are taken from Jakob Voss' DAIA library in Perl.
