Additional functionality

* implement DAIA::Error as object so you can also use
** ->error, ->addError, ->provideError

Additional methods

More tests and documentation
* better describe how to add properties (add/provide) and to query the structure
* document and test setting via unblessed struct
* test UTF-8 (when reading from streams), append*, ...
* more serialization and unserialization
* does it work on Windows ?
